# My Previous Portfolio Website (Archive)

This repository hosts an older version of my personal portfolio website, originally developed as a learning exercise to solidify my front-end web development skills.

**Live Demo:** [https://nigelnkomo.github.io/portfolio-old/](https://nigelnkomo.github.io/portfolio-old/)

### Project Highlights & Technologies Used:

* **Responsive Design:** Built from scratch using HTML and CSS to ensure a seamless experience across various devices (desktops, tablets, mobile phones). This project was key in developing my understanding of media queries and flexible layouts.
* **JavaScript Interactivity:** Implemented a custom JavaScript marquee, showcasing basic DOM manipulation and event handling.
* **Green Theme:** Explored design principles with a consistent green color palette.
* **Core Technologies:**
    * HTML5 (Structure)
    * CSS3 (Styling, including Flexbox/Grid for layout)
    * JavaScript (Client-side scripting for interactivity)

### Purpose & Learning:

This project was a significant step in my journey to understand the fundamentals of web development. While this version is an older iteration of my work (and contains outdated contact information), it stands as a testament to my commitment to self-learning and my ability to push through challenges to achieve desired design and functionality.

It allowed me to gain hands-on experience in:
* Translating a visual design concept into functional code.
* Debugging front-end issues.
* Ensuring cross-browser compatibility (at the time of creation).

### Future Plans:

I am continuously refining my web development skills and am actively improving my new portfolio iterations showcasing more advanced techniques and current projects.
